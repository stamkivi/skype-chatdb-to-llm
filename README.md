# Skype Chat History Analyzer

This tool allows you to analyze your Skype chat history using AI. It loads your Skype chat database, processes the messages, and lets you ask questions about your chat history using natural language.

## Features

- Load and analyze Skype chat databases (main.db)
- Generate statistics about your chat history
- Create a vector store for semantic search of your messages
- Ask questions about your chat history using natural language
- View full message context with surrounding messages

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skype-chatdb-to-llm.git
cd skype-chatdb-to-llm
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure you have Ollama installed and running with the Mistral model:
```bash
ollama pull mistral
```

## Usage

1. Find your Skype chat database file:
   - Windows: `%AppData%\Skype\<your-username>\main.db`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Skype/<your-username>/main.db`
   - Linux: `~/.Skype/<your-username>/main.db`

2. Copy the database file to a location of your choice.

3. Run the analyzer:
```bash
python main.py path/to/your/main.db
```

If you don't specify a database path, the tool will look for `.db` files in the current directory.

4. Ask questions about your chat history:
```
‚ùì Ask a question about your chats: Who did I chat with the most?
```

5. Special commands:
   - `full message`: Show the complete text of the last referenced message with context
   - `full message 2`: Show the second last referenced message with context
   - `exit` or `quit`: End the session

## Data Privacy

This tool processes your chat data locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers except when using the Ollama API, which also runs locally. Your chat history remains private.

## Compatibility

This tool is designed to work with Skype's SQLite database format. It has been tested with main.db for 5.x versions of Skype (circa 2012 backups), but database schema compatibility was definitely broken around Skype 8.0.
